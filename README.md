# Alternative paths

This code replicate BDV which is one of alternative paths algorithms from Alternative Routes in Road Networks paper.   
1. Change Dijkstra to Bidirectional Dijkstra.  
2. ADD conditions to filter out admissible paths.   
3. Sort all alternative paths based on cost function and Select the best three paths.   

## to do 
why choose this DSA.         
put presentation slides here.             

## Production

[Web](https://geonet.igg.uni-bonn.de/lbsproject-lara-ohm/  "title" target="_blank")

### Usage 
Show how to use the map.

## Contribution
This code is a part of the location based service module from the university of Bonn.    
We contribute Bidirectional Dijkstra, BDV and some part of the visualization of the web page.
